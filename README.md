# tinyCode_changeBackgroundColor
tinyCode site that changes the background color of the page using HEX values. 

First forray into starting from the nothing and building a project. Having seen this type of functionality
elsewhere I set about replicating it. Ran into some struggles with switching the hex code but worked them out and ended up with a successful project.
